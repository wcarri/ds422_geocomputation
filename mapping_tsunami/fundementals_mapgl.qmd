Welcome to your first creative exploration of **map design using R and the `mapgl` package**! In this tutorial, you'll:

-   Load spatial data using `tidycensus`
-   Create your first interactive maps with `mapgl`
-   Learn both **continuous** and **categorical** styling methods
-   Add interactivity like **tooltips** and **hover effects**

Let's dive in!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üì¶ Getting Started

Make sure you've installed the required packages:

Load libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(mapgl)
library(viridisLite)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(glue)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß≠ Load Hawaii Median House Hold Income Data

To create a meaningful map, we need **geospatial data** --- data that includes both attributes (e.g. median age) and geometry (e.g. Census tract boundaries).

The `tidycensus` package allows us to pull **American Community Survey (ACS)** data directly from the U.S. Census Bureau. When you use `geometry = TRUE`, you're telling R to return spatial features (polygons, points, or lines) alongside the statistics.

Let's look at what we're loading:

```{r}
hi_median_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B19013_001",  # median income
  state = "HI",
  year = 2023,
  geometry = TRUE
)

```

### üëÄ Explore the Data in the Viewer

Click on `hi_median_income` in your **Environment tab** or run `View(hi_median_income)` to open it as a spreadsheet.

Notice: - The `estimate` column shows the median age - The `geometry` column contains spatial polygons (`MULTIPOLYGON`) - This is an **`sf` object**, which stands for *Simple Features* --- this is what makes the data "mappable" in R

> ‚úÖ If your data has a `geometry` column and `sf` class, it's ready for cartographic visualization!

> ‚úÖ Now lets plot an interactive map centered on Hawaii

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Draw a blank map of Hawaii

```{r}
hi_map <- mapboxgl(mapbox_style("light"), bounds = hi_median_income)

hi_map
```

## üé® Continuous Styling

One of the most important choices in cartographic design is **how to represent your data visually** --- especially when it comes to **color**. Should you show your data as a **smooth gradient** or in **distinct categories**? That choice sends a message.

**Continuous color scales** use gradients to show smooth variation in a numeric variable --- like temperature, elevation, or median age. These are great when:

-   You want to emphasize gradual change
-   The viewer should see subtle differences between areas
-   You want the map to feel intuitive and data-rich

For example, a continuous palette of deep blue to light blue can subtly show where the median income is lower vs. higher --- without imposing artificial boundaries.

When designing with continuous color, think of it like painting with light: smooth tones invite exploration, nuance, and *feel* more natural.

Here's how we apply a continuous color scale to median income:

```{r}
continuous_scale <- interpolate_palette(
  data = hi_median_income,
  column = "estimate",
  method = "equal",
  n = 5,
  palette = magma
)

hi_map |>
  add_fill_layer(
    id = "hi_tracts",
    source = hi_median_income,
    fill_color = continuous_scale$expression,
    fill_opacity = 0.5
  ) |>
  add_legend(
    "Median Income in Hawaii",
    values = get_legend_labels(continuous_scale, digits = 0),
    colors = get_legend_colors(continuous_scale),
    type = "continuous"
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üß© **Challenge #1** -- Try a Different Color Scheme

Replace `plasma` with another palette (e.g., `viridis`, `magma`, or `cividis`). Which one feels the most readable? Why?

```{r}
palette = magma
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üßÆ Manual Styling with Interpolation

Lets see the min and max of median income

```{r}
min(hi_median_income$estimate, na.rm = TRUE)
max(hi_median_income$estimate, na.rm = TRUE)
```

What does this look like with other data viz?

```{r}
ggplot(hi_median_income, aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
  
```

```{r}
hi_map |>
  add_fill_layer(
    id = "hi_tracts",
    source = hi_median_income,
    fill_color = interpolate(
      column = "estimate",
      values = c(20000, 250000),
      stops = c("lightblue", "darkblue"),
      na_color = "lightgrey"
    ),
    fill_opacity = 0.5
  ) |>
  add_legend(
    "Median Income in Hawaii",
    values = c(20000, 250000),
    colors = c("lightblue", "darkblue")
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üî¢ Categorical Styling

In contrast to smooth gradients, **classified (categorical) color scales** divide your data into clear buckets. This approach is especially helpful when:

-   You want to simplify complex data
-   The audience needs clear takeaways (e.g., policy decisions, eligibility zones)
-   You're emphasizing **differences** between areas

Instead of saying "this place is a bit older," a categorical map might say "this tract is in the highest 20%. for median income" This clarity is powerful --- but it also means you're drawing visual boundaries that might not exist in reality.

As a cartographer, **you are making choices that influence interpretation**. Use this power carefully.

When designing categorical maps: - Choose palettes that are **visually distinct** (e.g., `RColorBrewer::brewer.pal()`) - Keep the number of categories reasonable (usually 4--7) - Match color progression to the narrative --- e.g., darker = more intense

> üé® A good map doesn't just show data --- it **communicates purpose** through design.

Here's how we apply quantile classification to Hawaii's Median Income:

```{r}
q_class <- step_quantile(
  data = hi_median_income,
  column = "estimate",
  n = 5,
  colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "PRGn")
)

hi_map |>
  add_fill_layer(
    id = "hi_tracts",
    source = hi_median_income,
    fill_color = q_class$expression,
    fill_opacity = 0.5
  ) |>
  add_legend(
    "Median Income in Hawaii",
    values = get_legend_labels(q_class, digits = 0, suffix = " $"),
    colors = get_legend_colors(q_class),
    type = "categorical"
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üß© **Challenge #2** -- Classify Differently

Let's apply your design instincts!

Try switching from `step_quantile()` to one of the following:

-   `step_equal_interval()` -- evenly spaced numeric breaks
-   `step_jenks()` -- natural breaks that minimize variance within groups

Type `?step_quantile` in your console to see definitions

How does your choice affect the message your map conveys?

üí¨ *What looks more balanced? Which palette aligns with your intended story?*

Write 1--2 sentences reflecting on the **cartographic message** your choices imply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question: What is the poverty line for a household in Hawaii?

Can we create a map that only shows above/below the poverty line

```{r}
hi_median_income <- hi_median_income |>
  mutate(
    mit_threshold = ifelse(estimate < 107689, "Below Line", "Above Line")
  )
```

```{r}
mit_colors <- c("Below Line" = "#d73027", "Above Line" = "#1a9850")

mapboxgl(bounds = hi_median_income) |>
  add_fill_layer(
    id = "hi_tracts",
    source = hi_median_income,
    fill_color = match_expr(
      column = "mit_threshold",
      values = names(mit_colors),
      stops = unname(mit_colors)
    ),
    fill_opacity = 0.6
  ) |>
  add_legend(
    "Median Income Status",
    values = names(mit_colors),
    colors = unname(mit_colors),
    type = "categorical"
  )


```

## Question: How else can we think about the poverty line and map?

### üß© **Challenge #3** -- Classify Differently

Make a binary map, two colors, representing above and below a threshold of median income that you determine based on an outside source like the ones hinted above

## ‚ú® Add Interactivity

```{r}
hi_median_income$popup <- glue(
  "<strong>Tract:</strong> {hi_median_income$NAME}<br><strong>Median income:</strong> {hi_median_income$estimate}"
)

hi_map |>
  add_fill_layer(
    id = "hi_tracts",
    source = hi_median_income,
    fill_color = interpolate(
      column = "estimate",
      values = c(20000, 250000),
      stops = c("lightblue", "darkblue"),
      na_color = "lightgrey"
    ),
    fill_opacity = 0.5,
    popup = "popup",
    tooltip = "estimate",
    hover_options = list(
      fill_color = "yellow",
      fill_opacity = 1
    )
  ) |>
  add_legend(
    "Median Income in Hawaii",
    values = c(20000, 250000),
    colors = c("lightblue", "darkblue")
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üß© **Challenge #4** -- Customize a Tooltip

Make your map more personal and informative!

Instead of just `estimate`, add other descriptive info in your popup. For example, use `NAME` (tract name) or `GEOID` along with the estimate.

```{r}
hi_median_income$popup <- glue(
  "<strong>Tract:</strong> {hi_median_income$NAME}<br><strong>Median income:</strong> {hi_median_income$estimate}"
)
```

Bonus: Try replacing `fill_color = "yellow"` with a color of your choice that aligns better with your map's aesthetic.

> üí° Cartographic design is about more than color --- it's about **clarity, context, and care** in visual choices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåü Challenge #5 -- Your Own Data!

Load median income, rent, or internet access for a different state using `tidycensus`. Here are a few suggestions: Use whatever state and variable you would like. You can also type this prompt into chat gpt: "what is the census code using tidycensus in R for median age?". It will most likely give you the correct variable code. Mao your variables using mapgl

| Variable   | Description              |
|------------|--------------------------|
| B01002_001 | Median age               |
| B25077_001 | Median home value        |
| B28002_004 | Households with internet |

```{r}
acs_vars <- load_variables(2022, "acs5", cache = TRUE)
```

#### A California Example

```{r}
# Example: Median income in California
ca_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  state = "CA",
  year = 2023,
  geometry = TRUE
)

ca_scale <- interpolate_palette(
  data = ca_income,
  column = "estimate",
  method = "equal",
  n = 4,
  palette = viridisLite::viridis
)

mapboxgl(bounds = ca_income) |>
  add_fill_layer(
    id = "ca_tracts",
    source = ca_income,
    fill_color = ca_scale$expression,
    fill_opacity = 0.5
  ) |>
  add_legend(
    "Median income in California",
    values = get_legend_labels(ca_scale, digits = 0, prefix = "$"),
    colors = get_legend_colors(ca_scale),
    type = "continuous"
  )

```

üîç Try: - Changing the variable to median home value- Switching the state (e.g., "HI", "NY", "TX") - Using a different styling function
